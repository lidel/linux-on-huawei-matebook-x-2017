## Background

First Huawei MateBook X was released in 2017.
It came with proprietary Microsoft Windows 10 and there was very little information available on its Linux support. 

I am running Debian on it. This repository documents what works and what does not.

## Power Management

Been testing it with Debian Stable + backported kernel 4.12. I've installed laptop-mode-tools (instead of TLP) and minimalist i3-wm (instead of Gnome).  With this setup and my workflow (mostly browser + ssh) the battery lasts for around 6-7 hours. Switching to more intensive things like code compilation or video encoding for prolonged time cuts battery to around 4 hours. 

TODO: document `laptop-mode-tools`

## Touchpad

I prefer natural (reversed) scrolling and tap-to-click.
Both behaviors are disabled by default, but can be easily enabled via libinput.

To test, change a property manually:

```
$ xinput list | grep Touchpad
    â†³ ELAN2201:00 04F3:3056 Touchpad          	id=10	[slave  pointer  (2)]

$ xinput list-props 10 | grep Tapping\ Enabled
    libinput Tapping Enabled (280):	0

$ xinput set-prop 10 280 1

$ xinput list-props 10 | grep Tapping\ Enabled
    libinput Tapping Enabled (280):	1
```

To make it permanent, create `/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/40-libinput.conf` with:

```
Section "InputClass"
        Identifier      "touchpad catchall"
        MatchIsTouchpad "on"
        Driver           "libinput"
EndSection

Section "InputClass"
        Identifier "tap-by-default"
        MatchIsTouchpad "on"
        MatchDriver "libinput"
        Option "Tapping" "on"
        Option "NaturalScrolling" "true"
        Option "AccelSpeed" "1"
        #Option "TappingButtonMap" "lmr"       
EndSection
```

## Display Backlight

Backlight controls can now be used with built-in keyboard short cuts, ([see details below](#keyboard))

Backlight control  may not work out of the box in userland tools such as `xbacklight`. 

To activate it, create `/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/30-intel.conf` with:

```
Section "Device"
    Identifier  "Card0"
    Driver      "intel"
    Option      "Backlight"  "intel_backlight"
EndSection
```

Reload X11. Now `xbacklight +10` should increase brightness by 10%. Hardware keys do not work yet, but one can to bind this to any keyboard combination (eg. `Mod4` (Windows key) + `F1` (brightness key))

If you want to get visual feedback on every change consider using [backlight-ctrl.sh](https://github.com/lidel/dotfiles/blob/master/bin/backlight-ctl.sh).


## Bluetooth

Tested with a mouse  (MX Anywhere 2S) and worked as expected. 

Following `apt install bluetooth` from [BluetoothUser](https://wiki.debian.org/BluetoothUser) guide should be enough.
I also installed `blueman` and run `blueman-applet &` for a handy tray icon in i3 status bar. 

### Bluetooth Troubleshooting

Bluetooth registers itself as an USB device and default power saving settings may be too aggressive for wireless mouse and keyboard. In my case mouse was unable to wake up from autosuspend so for now I just disable it on boot:

```bash
# Prevents the Bluetooth USB card from autosuspending, which (as of this edit) borks it
# Include this somewhere it gets called at boot, for optimal effect; e.g. /etc/rc.local
# Credit: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=2159645&page=6&p=12926730#post12926730
 
BTUSB_DEV="8087:0a2b"
BTUSB_BINDING="$(lsusb -d "$BTUSB_DEV" |
  cut -f 1 -d : |
  sed -e 's,Bus ,,' -e 's, Device ,/,' |
  xargs -I {} udevadm info -q path -n /dev/bus/usb/{} |
  xargs basename)"
 
 
echo "Disabling autosuspend for Bluetooth USB device: $BTUSB_BINDING..."
echo -1 > "/sys/bus/usb/devices/$BTUSB_BINDING/power/autosuspend_delay_ms"
```


If you are using a power management solution, you may want to see instructions below:

#### TLP

> I use `tlp` for power management. I had to set `USB_AUTOSUSPEND=0` in `/etc/default/tlp` to prevent random outages of USB and bluetooth (requiring a cold restart to correct). [#](https://github.com/lidel/linux-on-huawei-matebook-x-2017/issues/5#issue-339338858)

#### Laptop Model

If you use `laptop-mode` for power management, disable or tweak suspend rules in `/etc/laptop-mode/conf.d/bluetooth.conf`.


## Airplane Mode

Works as expected.

`rfkill list` shows current status of radio interfaces:

```
 rfkill list                                                                      ~
0: phy0: Wireless LAN
	Soft blocked: no
	Hard blocked: no
11: hci0: Bluetooth
	Soft blocked: no
	Hard blocked: no
```

Toggling "airplane mode": `rfkill block all` / `rfkill unblock all`

## Sound
Right channel audio can enabled with the use of alsa-tools and a script from omegadota, found [here](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1721987/comments/25).

Instructions:

1. Download the script provided by omegadota found here: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/1721987/comments/25

2. Copy the script to /usr/local/bin: 
```shell
sudo cp huawei-sound.sh /usr/local/bin/huawei-sound.sh
```

3. Add a new service to `/etc/systemd/service` to call the script like so:
```shell
$ sudo touch /etc/systemd/service/huawei-sound.service
```

4. Add the following details into your service:
```
[Unit]
Description=Huawei-soundfix

[Service]
Type=idle
ExecStart=/usr/bin/bash /usr/local/bin/huawei-sound.sh

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target suspend.target hibernate.target hybrid-sleep.target
```

5. Enable the service:
```shell
systemctl enable huawei-sound
```

6. Check that the service is running:
```shell
systemctl status huawei-sound
```

7. Run a stereo test to validate that right audio is working:
e..g https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TWJaFD6R2s


## Keyboard
Following the steps to fix right channel audio sound found [here](#sound) appears to fix the hotkeys issues, additionally, a kernel patch is being worked on [here](https://github.com/aymanbagabas/Huawei-WMI).
